<h1>
        <b><strong style="color: blue;">Abstract—</strong></b>In the present generation, 
         have become increasingly popular,
         people’s social lives has become more associated with these sites. <br><br><i>They use OSNsto keep in touch with each others, share news, organize events,
            and even run their own e-business.</i><br> The rabid growth of OSNs
and the massive amount of personal data of its <b><mark>subscribers have
    attracted attackers, and imposters to steal personal data, share
    false news, and spread malicious activities</mark></b>. <br>On the other hand
researchers have started to investigate an efficient techniques
to detect abnormal activities and fake accounts relying on
accounts features, and classification algorithms.<br> <br>However, some
of the account’s exploited features have negative contribution
in the final results or have no impact, also using stand alone
classification algorithms does not always reach satisfied results.<br>
In this paper, a new algorithm, SVM-NN, is proposed to
provide efficient detection for fake Twitter accounts and bots,
four feature selection and dimension reduction techniques
were applied.<br><br> Three machine learning classification algorithms
were used to decide the target accounts identity real or fake,
those algorithms were support vector machine (SVM), neural
Network (NN), and our newly developed algorithm, SVM-NN,
that uses less number of features, while still being able to
correctly classify about 98% of the accounts of our training
dataset.
